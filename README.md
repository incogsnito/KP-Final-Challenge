<h1>KP-Final-Challenge</h1>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
This was the last challenge offered by kevin powell's responsive design course.
Link for anyone that wants to check it out: https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts.
I needed to grasp a basic understanding on how responsive web pages are made. This course did an excellent job.
In total it took me around 25-28 days to finish.
Ran into a lot of bugs that the lessons didn't teach me how to fix, but it stretched my problem solving skills. It improved me a lot and not just with it's contents.
There will be bugs trying to tackle this challenge that will not be explained in the challenge but that's actually perfect. It would've been boring if the work wasn't stressing me out.

<h2>Problems</h2>
1. I ran into a lot of trouble with overflowing text.
2. I would have multiple errors with containers.
3. Aligning things.
4. Setting widths.
5. Finding out what was breaking my whole page.

<h2>How I solved them</h2>
1. Learned about clamp.
2. learned how nesting works and am getting better at using them.
3. Used borders to find out what was going on. Then searched up my problem.
4. Max and min width especially on images.
5. I would use some JS code to find some errors with things.

<h2>Conclusion
</h2>
All in all, this was a fun course to complete and it's definitely boosted my knowledge on a lot. I will return to building layouts with the knowledge I've gained and will be working on becoming proficient with HTML and CSS and will be moving to Javascript after I have a deeper understanding of HTML and CSS.
I would recommend Kevin's course to anyone who wants to learn the basics and some intermediate level things about responsive layouts.
Thanks for checking out my repository!
